# Changelog

## [0.10.1] - 2025-08-31

### ‚ú® Features

- Implemented the unique daily trait-swapping mechanic for the **Djinn** species.
- Added a "Change Trait" button to the Actor Sheet header that is only visible for Djinn characters.
- The button's logic removes the current Djinn trait, prompts the user to select a new one from the species' defined options, and adds the new trait item to the sheet, automatically updating any associated skill bonuses.

### üîß Maintenance

- Added `isDjinn` check to `ActorSheet.getData` to control UI visibility for the "Change Trait" button.
- Created the `_onChangeDjinnTrait` handler in `SurgeCharacterSheet` to manage the trait swapping logic.

## [0.10.0] - 2025-08-31

### ‚ú® Features

- Implemented the core of the **Character Creation (Manual Selection)** workflow.
- Added automated logic for dropping a `Species` item onto a new Actor Sheet (`_onDropItem handler`). The drop handler now automatically:
  - Applies the species' attribute bonus.
  - Sets base passives (Movement, Recovery, Menace).
  - Calculates and rolls starting HP (`Strength Roll + Species Base HP`) and updates the sheet.
  - Prompts the user to select a "Chosen Trait" from a list defined on the species item.
  - Adds the chosen `Trait` item and the `Species` item to the character's sheet.
- Implemented a system for `Trait` items to grant skill bonuses, which are now automatically calculated and applied to skill totals and rolls.
- Added a dynamic status label to the Actor Sheet header (e.g., "Unknown Species", "Ponturi (The Manta Ray)") that updates after character creation.
- Added a "?‚Äù placeholder for passive stats (HP, Recovery, etc.) on a blank character sheet, which updates to numerical values after a species is applied.
- Added UI to the Item Sheet for `species` and `trait` item types, including dropdowns for attributes/skills.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Fixed `traitItems is not defined` error in `ActorSheet.getData` by correcting the function's code.
- Resolved rendering issues on the Item Sheet for new types (`spell`, `trait`, `species`), including a bug where fields were not appearing due to the types being missing from the `Items.registerSheet` registration list.
- Fixed a bug where a faulty `template.json` definition for `spell` items caused the Description field to initialize as an object instead of a string.

### üîß Maintenance

- Created Compendium packs for "SURGE! Species" and "SURGE! Traits" and added initial data (Ponturi species and its traits).
- Updated `ActorSheet.getData` to calculate and display derived skill totals (base + trait bonuses) and species/trait info.
- Updated `_onSkillRoll` to use the total derived skill level for rolls.
- Added `attributes` and `skills` lists to `CONFIG.SURGE` for populating dropdown menus on Item Sheets.
- Updated `item-sheet.hbs` with conditional logic (`#unless` or `#if`/`ne`) to hide common fields for `trait` and `species` types for a cleaner UI.

## [0.9.0] - 2025-05-09

### ‚ú® Features

- Implemented Death Saving Throw system:
  - Automatic transition to "Dying (Conscious)" state when HP drops to 0 (via `updateActor` hook), applying "Dying (Conscious)" Active Effect (sets movement to 0, stores DR level).
  - Added HP-based status label ("Healthy", "Bloodied", "Dying - Conscious", "Dying - Unconscious", "Dead") to Actor Sheet header.
  - Added "Make Death Save" button to Actor Sheet header, enabled when actor is in a death save state.
  - Implemented Death Save logic (`_onMakeDeathSave`): Prompts for STR/Survival, rolls against escalating DR (Easy DR starts at 5, increases; DR resets on stage transition from Conscious to Unconscious), handles success/failure for both Conscious and Unconscious stages.
  - Failure in Unconscious stage results in applying the core "Dead" status (skull icon).
  - Healing an actor with >0 HP who was "Dead" or in a death save state now correctly removes these states and updates the UI label/button.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Resolved `ReferenceError: currentActorDeathSaveStageReadFromActorFlags is not defined` in `handleActorUpdate` hook.
- Corrected logic in `ActorSheet.getData` for `hpStatusLabel` to reliably detect and display "Dead" and "Dying - Conscious/Unconscious" states by checking effect flags.
- Fixed issue where "Dead" status was not applied correctly due to missing "dead" ID in custom `CONFIG.statusEffects`.
- Fixed issue where "Dead" status was not removed upon revival (HP > 0).

### üîß Maintenance

- Created "Dying (Conscious)" and "Dying (Unconscious)" Active Effect data definitions, storing stage and DR level directly on effect flags.
- Added Difficulty Rating (DR) level-to-value mapping to `CONFIG.SURGE` for Death Saves.
- Updated `handleActorUpdate` hook to manage entry into, transition between, and exit from death save states based on HP changes.
- Added "dead" status definition to `SURGE_STATUS_EFFECTS` to integrate with Foundry's core defeated status display.
