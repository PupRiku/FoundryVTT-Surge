[![Foundry Compatibility](https://img.shields.io/badge/Foundry%20VTT-v12.331%2B-informational)](https://foundryvtt.com/releases/)
_Note: Compatibility verified specifically for v12.331 during development. Untested on later versions._

## Introduction

This is an unofficial community system implementation for the **SURGE!** tabletop roleplaying game ([SURGE! TTRPG Homepage](https://sites.google.com/warpedtree.com/www-warpedtree-com/products/surge?authuser=0)), designed for use with the Foundry Virtual Tabletop platform.

This system is currently **under active development** (pre-release) but now includes functional character sheets, item sheets, core dice rolling, and implementation for numerous status effects/conditions.

## Installation

**Important:** This system is currently in a pre-release state (v0.10.1). Features may be incomplete or change. Use with caution!

1.  Open the Foundry VTT Setup screen.
2.  Navigate to the "Game Systems" tab.
3.  Click the "Install System" button.
4.  In the "Manifest URL" field... paste the following URL for the **v0.11.0** release:
    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PupRiku/Found-VTT-Surge/v0.11.0/system.json
    ```
5.  Click "Install".

Foundry will download and install the system. You can then create a new world using the SURGE! system.

## Current Features (as of v0.9.0)

- **Basic System Structure:** `system.json` manifest, `template.json` data models (Character, various Item types). Basic CSS styling. Includes Macro Compendium pack.
- **Character Sheet:**
  - Functional sheet window with Header (Name, Image, Level, Passives Grid) and Tabs (Main, Inventory, Spellbook, Biography, Effects).
  - **Header:** Displays core info; Total Menace updates automatically. **Now includes a dynamic Species/Trait display and HP-based status label (e.g., Healthy, Bloodied, Dying).**
  - **Main Tab:** Displays Attributes and **derived total Skill values** (Base + Trait Bonuses) with editable base values and rollable labels.
  - **Inventory Tab:** Categorized item display (Weapons, Armor/Shields, Gear) with functional Edit, Delete, Equip/Unequip controls. Attack/Damage roll buttons on weapons.
  - **Biography Tab:** Rich text editors for all biography fields.
  - **Effects Tab:** Displays active effects applied to the actor with working Toggle (Enable/Disable), Edit, and Delete controls (using custom handlers).
- **Item Sheet:**
  - Basic functional sheet for viewing/editing items.
  - Common fields (Name, Image, Description, Qty, Wt, Price).
  - Type-specific fields for Weapons, Armor, & Shields.
  - Fields & layout for "spell", **"species"**, and **"trait"** item types.
- **Character Creation (v0.10.2):**
  - Automated character setup via **drag-and-drop of a `Species` item** from the compendium onto the actor sheet.
  - When a species is applied, the system automatically:
    - Applies attribute bonuses.
    - Calculates and rolls starting Hit Points based on Strength.
    - Sets base passives (Movement, Recovery, Menace).
    - Prompts the user to select a "Chosen Trait" via a dialog window.
  - Implemented `Trait` items that grant skill bonuses, which are automatically calculated and applied to skill totals and rolls.
  - Blank character sheets now display "?" for key stats, which populate after a species is added.
  - Created Compendium packs for Species and Traits with initial Ponturi data.
  - **(v0.10.1)** Added special functionality for the Djinn species to allow for their daily 'Chosen Trait' to be changed via a button on the actor sheet.
- **Character Advancement (v0.11.0):**
  - Implemented the Buy Point Level System.
  - Characters gain Buy Points (BP) upon leveling up (8 + bonus from Intelligence).
  - Players can spend BP via buttons on the actor sheet to increase Attribute and Skill levels.
  - Costs are automatically calculated (flat for attributes, variable for skills based on total level).
  - UI provides feedback on BP cost and disables buttons when unaffordable or at max level.
- **Dice Rolling & Mechanics:**
  - Core SURGE! roll mechanic (`Xd6x6+Y` lookup + `x6` SURGING) via `_performRoll`.
  - Attribute/Skill checks rollable from Actor Sheet.
  - Rolls incorporate applicable bonuses/penalties from stats, equipped items, **and owned Traits**.
  - Weapon Attack/Damage rolls triggerable from Inventory, calculating damage via `_performDamageRoll`.
  - Defense rolls (Melee, Ranged, Magic) triggerable via Ctrl+Click.
  - Rolls incorporate applicable bonuses/penalties from stats and equipped items.
  - Contested rolls for spellcasting.
- **Death Saving Throw System:**
  - Characters dropping to 0 HP automatically enter a two-stage (Conscious, then Unconscious) death save process with escalating DR.
  - Includes UI elements on actor sheet header (status label, save button).
  - Healing from 0 HP or "Dead" state correctly removes dying/dead states.
- **Status Effects & Conditions:**
  - Dynamic registration of system-specific status effect icons, replacing core defaults.
  - Implementation of numerous conditions with automated mechanics where practical:
    - **Automated Effects:** Movement=0 (Crushed, Frozen, Paralyzed, Restrained, Prone, Pinned), DEX Check Auto-Fail (Restrained, Prone, Pinned, Incapacitated, Unconscious), INT/CHA Check Penalty (Confused), Magic Defense Penalty (Deafened), Guile Bonus (Invisible), Physical Attack Prevention (Crushed, Pinned).
    - **Damage/Healing Interactions:** Damage removes Stunned (via `updateActor` hook), Escalating Damage/Turn (Burning, Bleeding via `updateCombat` hook), Damage/Turn (Frozen, Damage Poison via `updateCombat` hook), Damage on Move (Chilled via `updateToken` hook), Damage Vulnerability (Flammable doubles Burning, Broken doubles Physical via `_performDamageRoll`), Damage Immunity (Flame Resistant prevents Burning via macro).
    - **Condition Interactions:** Confused prevents Frightened (via status `overrides`), Wet prevents Burning (via override/macro), Wet removes Flammable (via macro), Insulated prevents Chilled (via override/macro), Insulated removes Frozen (via `updateCombat` hook), Incapacitated/Stunned/Unconscious apply Prone (via macro).
    - **Complex Conditions:** Confused (random start-of-turn behavior via hook/chat), Poisoned subtypes (Sickness/Debilitating apply random secondary effects/durations via macro; Deadly triggers HP 0 + Incapacitated after 5 combat turns via hook).
    - **Weapon Interactions:** Added a field in the the item sheet to specify conditions a weapon will apply when damaging a target. This will automatically apply the condition(s).
  - **Spellcasting:**
    - Defined "spell" item type with comprehensive data fields (School, Casting Time, Range, Target, Duration, Focus req., Defender Attr., Damage/Heal/Condition effects).
    - Item sheet supports viewing/editing spell data.
    - Actor sheet includes a "Spellbook" tab listing owned spells.
    - "Cast" button on spell items initiates casting process.
    - Implemented core contested roll mechanic (Mystic+INT vs Defender).
    - Basic application of damage, healing, and conditions from spells upon successful cast against targets.
    - Mute condition prevents casting.
  - **GM Adjudication:** Many conditions rely on GM ruling for effects not easily automated (e.g., action restrictions for Frightened/Paralyzed/Stunned/Unconscious/Mute, perception checks for Invisible/Deafened, immunities for Flame Resistant/Insulated, specific remedies like Patch Up/Break Free/Heat Sources). Descriptions added to effects as reminders.
  - **Macros:** Compendium pack created ("SURGE! Condition Macros") containing macros to apply each condition (including prerequisite/stacking checks and input dialogs where needed).
  - **Workarounds:** Implemented workarounds/notes for known core Foundry bugs (e.g., round duration expiry).

## Planned Features / To-Do

- **Refine Condition Mechanics:** Implement specific Condition Actions (Break Free, Patch Up, Shake Off Stun, Stand Up).
- **Refine Spellcasting System:** Implement Focus mechanic (concentration checks); Handle multi-turn casting times & action costs; Implement Area of Effect targeting/templates; Refine spell damage/healing application; Implement Mending school healing interaction with Unconscious.
- **Item Sheet Enhancements:** UI for editing array data (DR, Penalties); Layouts for remaining item types (Gear, Tool, Medicine, Antidotes, Brace, etc.).
- **Combat Options:** Unarmed Strike, Grapple, Shove, Shield HP/Blocking, Dodge/Counter, Kevlar mechanics.
- **NPC Sheet:** Design data model and sheet.
- **Compendia:** Packs for base items (weapons, armor, gear, remedies), spells, and example actors/NPCs. _(Species/Traits are now done)_.
- **Styling & Polish:** Continue refining CSS and usability.
- **Code Refinement:** Remove debug logging; Centralize damage/healing application.
